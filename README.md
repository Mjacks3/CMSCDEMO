# Numerical-Analysis-of-Customer-Review-Data

Hey there. What you're looking at in this repostory is a submission of a semester long academic project for a class called Numerical Computation. My project used utilized linear and polynomial regression on a set of 300,000 amazon.com reviews  
with variables: time, helpfulnessrating, lexical diveristy, sentiment and keyword frequency 
as they related to a reviewer's overal product score in order to see if I could find any interesting trends. 

The project submission required the submission of all code used. Additionaly submitted is  the project paper and an excel file with useful
statistics as they related to the regression models. I utilized data from http://jmcauley.ucsd.edu/data/amazon/ for my reviews.

For any questions, contact me at mjacks3@umbc.edu
Thanks.
