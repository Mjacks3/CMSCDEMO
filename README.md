# Numerical-Analysis-of-Customer-Review-Data

Hey there. What you're looking in this repostory is a submission of an academic project for a class called Numerical Computation.
My project used logistic regression to model trends in amazon reviews. I utilized linear and polynomial regression on 
a set of 300,000 reviews with variables: time, helpfulnessrating, lexical diveristy, sentiment and keyword frequency 
as they related to a reviewer's overal product score in order to see if I could find any interesting trends. 

In lieu of a paper, the project submission required the submission of all code used. additionaly submitted is an excel file with useful
statistics as they related to regression.

I utilized data from http://jmcauley.ucsd.edu/data/amazon/.
